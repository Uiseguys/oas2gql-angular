`npm run build:prod`

Navigate to `localhost:8080`. Use `admin/1234` or `test/test` as credentials.

You can also use the `ng serve` command to run the server and watch for file changes. However you will need to either 

* install and run the other 2 services 

or 

* update development env vars to match their production counterparts
